Show a warning message when your blog visibility is blocked for search engines. Also, hides the de-indexing option.

== Description ==

Show a warning message in admin header area when your blog visibility is blocked for search engines.

Also, when your blog is visible for everyone, hides the de-indexing option to avoid accidental changes.

== Installation ==

1. Download the plugin from Wordpress plugin repository
1. Upload all files contained in visibility-warning.zip file to the `/wp-content/plugins/visibility-warning/` directory of your wordpress install (or in mu-plugins directory).
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How I can block again my web site if the Privacy menu link is hidden? =

There are two ways, if you deactivate your plugin the menu link will appear. Or in the URL textbox of your browser, modify at the end of the URL and type /wp-admin/options-privacy.php (only for WordPress versions < 3.5).
For recent WordPress versions deactivate this plugin if you want to access to the option of discourage search engines from indexing this site in Reading Settings.

But for SEO purposes this is not recommended if your site has previously been indexed by google.
